# Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## Position, Displacement, and Distance

### Position

The position of an object is its location relative to a chosen reference point or origin. It's typically represented by a position vector.

$$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$$

### Displacement

Displacement is the change in position of an object. It's a vector quantity:

$$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i$$

### Distance

Distance is the total length of the path traveled by an object. It's a scalar quantity and is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement.

## Velocity

### Average Velocity

Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval:

$$\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}$$

### Instantaneous Velocity

Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific moment in time:

$$\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$$

## Acceleration

### Average Acceleration

Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval:

$$\vec{a}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}$$

### Instantaneous Acceleration

Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a specific moment in time:

$$\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$

## Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)

1. $$\vec{v} = \vec{v}_0 + \vec{a}t$$
2. $$\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_0t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2$$
3. $$\vec{v}^2 = \vec{v}_0^2 + 2\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0)$$
4. $$\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + \frac{1}{2}(\vec{v}_0 + \vec{v})t$$

## Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is a form of motion where an object is projected into the air and moves under the influence of
