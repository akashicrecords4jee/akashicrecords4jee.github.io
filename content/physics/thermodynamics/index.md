# Mechanics

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects under the action of forces.

## Topics in this Chapter

- [Kinematics](/physics/mechanics/kinematics)
- [Newton's Laws of Motion](/physics/mechanics/newtons-laws)
- [Work, Energy, and Power](/physics/mechanics/work-energy-power)
- [Circular Motion](/physics/mechanics/circular-motion)
- [Rotational Dynamics](/physics/mechanics/rotational-dynamics)

## Introduction to Mechanics

Mechanics forms the foundation of classical physics and is essential for understanding more advanced topics. This chapter covers the fundamental principles that govern the motion of objects, from simple linear motion to complex rotational dynamics.

## Key Concepts

- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Force and its effects
- Work, energy, and their conservation
- Momentum and its conservation
- Rotational motion and angular momentum
