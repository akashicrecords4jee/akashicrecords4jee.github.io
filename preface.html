            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This book/blog is meant to be a freely accessible and in-depth resource for learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination">JEE</a>, and science in general up to a high-school level.</p>
<p>We believe in unrestricted access to education for all regardless of whether they are enrolled in some prestigious instituition or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When education is open source, knowledge multiplies exponentially—each shared insight becomes a seed for innovation, much like open code that evolves into a robust, collective intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In-fact this book/blog is not maintained by some "money-hungry" instituition but rather Jee-aspirants and ex-Jee-aspirants themselves.</p>

<h1 id="ways-to-approach-this-bookblog">Ways to approach this book/blog</h1>
<p>Nowadays, there are plenty of <em>good</em> free resources available online.
We try our best to reference all of them, but more importantly show you the right path to follow.</p>
<p>We do not believe in the <strong>"gamified approach"</strong> to teaching. One should let their <strong>curiosity</strong>, and <strong>love for science and problem solving</strong> fuel them. So we try to keep distractions to a minimum with a simple design.
To double-down on the fact that curiosity is important, we will provide regular <code>case studies</code>, <code>historical developments</code>, and <code>things to explore</code>. One does <strong>not have to follow them</strong> but we believe that, it should be irresistible to the ones that actually care.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-schools-of-thought">The Two Schools Of Thought</h2>
<p>There are in general two ways of approaching any problem (in a JEE as well as general setting).
Only a master of both, can solve problems effectively. We will be showing both approaches, for most questions listed here, so one can pick what works best for them.</p>
<h3 id="the-symbolicalgebraic-approach">The Symbolic/Algebraic Approach</h3>
<p>In this type of thought process one focuses purely on the <strong>equations</strong>, and only find answers via algebraic manipulation.
This approach allows us to abstract away the complexities of the actual problem, and rely solely on mathematical rules, that have already been learnt. It allows us to <strong>detach the problem from its setting</strong>.
Some people are naturally more inclined towards this approach and can solve equations pretty fast. But as it so happens some may also struggle with numbers, and the symbolic notation in general. Therefore we also propose an alternative method.</p>
<h3 id="the-visual-spatialdiagrammatic-approach">The Visual-Spatial/Diagrammatic Approach</h3>
<p>In this type of method one focuses of the <strong>graphs</strong> and <strong>diagrams</strong>. It requires a strong understanding of how graphs work, what the slopes are, the intercepts, etc. One might see numerous demerits in such a way of thinking, but as it turns out- It leads to some of the most beautiful solutions as you will see later on in this book/blog. Unironically, the advantage of this method cannot be put into words, but can only be shown through problem-solutions.</p>
<h2 id="citationssources">Citations/Sources:</h2>
<p>We try to collect information from as many sources as possible. However we still try our best to cite all of them, to give credit where it's due, and not take credit for unoriginal tricks, or methods.
All sources used in writing a specific topic/chapter will be linked down in the <code>Bibliography</code> section. We hope you will take a look for further research as well as out of curiosity.</p>
