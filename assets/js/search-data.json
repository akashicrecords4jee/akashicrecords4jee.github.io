We believe in unrestricted access to education for all regardless of whether they are enrolled in some prestigious instituition or not. When education is open source, knowledge multiplies exponentially—each shared insight becomes a seed for innovation, much like open code that evolves into a robust, collective intelligence. In-fact this book/blog is not maintained by some “money-hungry” instituition but rather Jee-aspirants and ex-Jee-aspirants themselves. ",

    "content": "Nowadays, there are plenty of good free resources available online. We try our best to reference all of them, but more importantly show you the right path to follow. We do not believe in the “gamified approach” to teaching. One should let their curiosity, and love for science and problem solving fuel them. So we try to keep distractions to a minimum with a simple design. To double-down on the fact that curiosity is important, we will provide regular case studies, historical developments, and things to explore. One does not have to follow them but we believe that, it should be irresistible to the ones that actually care. ",

This approach allows us to abstract away the complexities of the actual problem, and rely solely on mathematical rules, that have already been learnt. It allows us to detach the problem from its setting. Some people are naturally more inclined towards this approach and can solve equations pretty fast. But as it so happens some may also struggle with numbers, and the symbolic notation in general. Therefore we also propose an alternative method. ",

Unironically, the advantage of this method cannot be put into words, but can only be shown through problem-solutions. ",
