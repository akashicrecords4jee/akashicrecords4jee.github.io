# The Problem And History

The need for vectors in physics arises from the fundamental question:

> How do we describe direction?

Typically we would just point with our fingers or say "right" or "left", but clearly this would not make any sense for mathematical calculations.
We need a **robust, mathematical way** to represent direction.

Although the concept of vectors taught in the modern way seems easy, we must first analyse **how they came to be.** You may skip [ahead](#the-concept) if the history does not spark your interests.
## The First attempt
 In the 16th century, mathematicians like [Girolamo Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano) began exploring solutions to equations that led to the concept of **complex numbers**, which have both real and imaginary parts.
