## Overview
A combined topic in both **PHYSICS & CHEMISTRY**, however it has been put in the chemistry section as it covers more on average.

One must be very careful while reading this chapter, as it may either leave you entirely confused, and questioning your existence, OR absolutely thrilled.

This is however one of those chapters where the [Visual-Spatial approach](/preface/#the-visual-spatialdiagrammatic-approach) might actually be a hinderance than an advantage, keeping in mind the kinds of questions asked in JEE. However *it does kind of enhance the beauty* of the chapter, so it is still up to the reader.
